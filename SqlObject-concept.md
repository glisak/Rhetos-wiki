Allows creating any SQL object as a part of generated application.
**SqlObject** is intended to be used as a workaround when existing DSL concepts for [database objects](https://github.com/Rhetos/Rhetos/wiki/Database-objects) (**Unique**, **SqlIndex**, **SqlView**, **SqlTrigger**, etc) are not sufficient.

Implemented in Rhetos package: *CommonConcepts*.

## Features

* Set custom SQL script to create and remove the object in the database.
* Define creation order of dependent SQL objects.
* Create SQL objects without transaction (full-text search index, e.g.).

## Dependencies and creation order of SQL objects

Use any of the **SqlDependsOn...** concepts in an **SqlObject** to define other objects (entites, views, etc) that need to be created before the **SqlObject**.

If another object (**SqlQueryable**, for example) depends on the **SqlObject**, use **SqlDependsOnSqlObject** to make sure that the **SqlObject** is created in database before the view from the **SqlQueryable**.

    Module Demo
    {
        Entity SomeEntity { Integer I; }

        SqlObject SomeView
            "CREATE VIEW Demo.V1 AS SELECT ID, I+1 AS I1 FROM Demo.SomeEntity"
            "DROP VIEW Demo.V1"
        {
            SqlDependsOn Demo.SomeEntity;
        }

        SqlQueryable SomeEntityAdditionalInfo
            "SELECT ID, I1+1 AS I2 FROM Demo.V1"
        {
            Extends Demo.SomeEntity;
            Integer I2;
            SqlDependsOnSqlObject Demo.SomeView;
        }
    }

## Creating SQL objects without transaction

Some SQL object cannot be created in a trasaction (**full-text search index** on SQL Server, e.g.).

By default, Rhetos will execute all SQL scripts in a transaction, unless the script starts with comment `/*DatabaseGenerator:NoTransaction*/`.

This example (from Rhetos unit tests) creates an SQL view, adding the transaction level (`@@TRANCOUNT`) as the suffix to the view name, to prove that the create script is executed without a transaction.

    Module Demo
    {
        SqlObject WithoutTransaction
            "
                /*DatabaseGenerator:NoTransaction*/
                DECLARE @createView nvarchar(max);
                SET @createView = 'CREATE VIEW Demo.WithoutTransaction_' + CONVERT(NVARCHAR(max), @@TRANCOUNT) + ' AS SELECT a=1';
                EXEC (@createView);
            "
            "
                /*DatabaseGenerator:NoTransaction*/
                DECLARE @dropView nvarchar(max);
                SELECT @dropView = name FROM sys.objects o WHERE type = 'V' AND SCHEMA_NAME(schema_id) = 'Demo' AND name LIKE 'WithoutTransaction[_]%';
                SET @dropView = 'DROP VIEW Demo.' + @dropView;
                EXEC (@dropView);
            ";
    }

## Splitting SQL script to multiple batches

If an SQL script contains the `GO` statement (T-SQL), the deployment will fail with an error message **Incorrect syntax near 'GO'.**

Note that Rhetos internally just uses SqlCommand to directly execute the script.

Rhetos introduces a custom batch splitter "`{SPLIT SCRIPT}`" to be used in a situation
when a single SQL script must be split to multiple batches that are executed separately.

Example:

    Module Demo
    {
        SqlObject TwoViews
            "
                CREATE VIEW Demo.V1 AS SELECT C = 1;
                {SPLIT SCRIPT}
                CREATE VIEW Demo.V2 AS SELECT C FROM V1;
            "
            "
                DROP VIEW Demo.V2;
                DROP VIEW Demo.V1;
            ";
    }
