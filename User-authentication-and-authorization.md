## Authentication

*Authentication* refers to a process of establishing the user's identity.
For example, by providing the username and the password.

### Windows Authentication

Rhetos supports Windows Authentication *by default*, so the users can
automatically log in to the web application inside the Windows domain.

For additional administration features, such as automatic synchronization
with the **Active Directory user groups**, see "Automatic user management"
in [Basic permissions](Basic-permissions#automatic-user-management).

### Forms Authentication

If the web application must be accessed from outside of Windows Domain
(for example, a public application), use the **forms authentication** instead.
The users will log in by typing a username and a password.

* Install forms authentication by including the [AspNetFormsAuth](https://github.com/Rhetos/AspNetFormsAuth)
  plugin package and follow the additional instruction in the package's readme file.
* Optional plugin [AspNetFormsAuthImpersonation](https://github.com/Rhetos/AspNetFormsAuthImpersonation)
  allows the administrator to log in as another user for debugging and support.
* [SimpleSPRTEmail](https://github.com/Rhetos/SimpleSPRTEmail) plugin adds an
  authentication service method "Send password reset token" for sending emails if a user forgot the password.

### Additional authentication options

A custom authentication plugin may be added by implementing the
[IUserInfo](https://github.com/Rhetos/Rhetos/blob/master/Source/Rhetos.Utilities/IUserInfo.cs) interface
and registering the new implementation as the Rhetos server plugin.
See [Implementing Rhetos authentication plugins](Implementing-Rhetos-authentication-plugins) article
for more details on the topic.

## Authorization

*Authorization* refers to a process of deciding which operations a user is allowed to perform in the system, and which will be denied.

There are two subsystems available for the authorization of user access in the Rhetos applications.

1. [Basic permissions (Claims)](Basic-permissions)
    * The access rights are typically defined by the roles that a user has (entered by the administrator).
    * The basic element of access is an operation on an entity (read/insert/update/delete) or an action.
2. [Row permissions](RowPermissions-concept)
    * Programmable permissions.
    * The access rights are implemented on an entity to allow some users access **a subset** of the entity's records.
