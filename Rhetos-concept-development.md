Rhetos DSL concept is the base of the Rhetos DSL platform. It consists from declaration of the DSL keyword and the implementation behind it. The CommonConcepts Rhetos package already implements a number of DSL concepts which can be used to build your application.

However, if you need some specific business rule or mechanism that is repetitive the best way to implement it is to write your own Rhetos DSL concept.

## What is Rhetos DSL concept

As stated before, Rhetos DSL concept is the base of the Rhetos DSL platform. From an application developer's perspective Rhetos DSL concept is a DSL keyword which assumes some syntax and functionality, and can be used to declare some data structure, business rule, etc.

From a platform developer's perspective Rhetos DSL concept is a structured way to develop some functionality and bring it to the application developer. This new functionality can then be used any number of times only by stating specific keyword in the application's DSL script.

For example, let's say that we need to ensure all the phone numbers in our application must be stated in a structured way. We can do that by adding a regex validation to all the properties which contains a phone number. Something like this:

    Module Bookstore
    {
        Entity Employee
        {
            ShortString PrimaryPhoneNumber { RegexMatch "^[+]*[(]{0,1}[0-9]{1,4}[)]{0,1}[-\s\./0-9]*$" "Invalid phone number format."; }
            ShortString SecondaryPhoneNumber { RegexMatch "^[+]*[(]{0,1}[0-9]{1,4}[)]{0,1}[-\s\./0-9]*$" "Invalid phone number format."; }
            ShortString FaxNumber { RegexMatch "^[+]*[(]{0,1}[0-9]{1,4}[)]{0,1}[-\s\./0-9]*$" "Invalid phone number format."; }
            ShortString MobileNumber { RegexMatch "^[+]*[(]{0,1}[0-9]{1,4}[)]{0,1}[-\s\./0-9]*$" "Invalid phone number format."; }
        }
    }

The DSL way of implementing the same feature is to write a new concept and use that concept, instead of repetitive copying the same code. After writing such a concept (let's say we call it PhoneNumber), we can then use it our DSL script like this:

    Module Bookstore
    {
        Entity Employee
        {
            PhoneNumber PrimaryPhoneNumber;
            PhoneNumber SecondaryPhoneNumber;
            PhoneNumber FaxNumber;
            PhoneNumber MobileNumber;
        }
    }

Implementing functionality this way is not only more elegant and human readable, but also easier to test and change in the future, since the implementation is centralized.

## How it works

From a Rhetos DSL platform perspective concept is a code generator which inserts a specific part of code to a specific place in already generated code. One concept depends on the other, and that's how your code is structured from your DSL scripts. Bearing that in mind, we have the following types of DSL concepts:

* basic concept - concept that defines a DSL keyword and have a code generator which implements functionality
* macro concept - concept which does not generate but compose (generate) a couple of other concepts to implement some functionality
* mixed concept - combination of two types mentioned above

Choosing of what type of concept to implement depends on functionality that we want to achieve.

## How to write a macro concept

What every concept needs is definition of it's DSL syntax. This is done by implementing IConceptInfo interface and exposing it via MEF (using Export attribute). IConceptInfo interface is defined in Rhetos.Dsl.Interfaces assembly which is part of Rhetos core. You also need to define a DSL keyword for your concept this is done by adding ConceptKeyword attribute (defined in the same assembly). Coding standard for defining concept definition class is [ConceptKeyword]Info (e.g.. PhoneNumberInfo). You can define concept definition class from scratch or inherit an existing one, depends on what your requirements are.
Let's try to write the PhoneNumber concept from previous example. Phone numbers are stored in string properties so we will build our new concept around ShortString concept (defined in Rhetos.Dsl.DefaultConcepts assembly).

Example:

``` csharp
using System.ComponentModel.Composition;
using Rhetos.Dsl;
using Rhetos.Dsl.DefaultConcepts;

namespace MyFirstConcept
{
    [Export(typeof(IConceptInfo))]
    [ConceptKeyword("PhoneNumber")]
    public class PhoneNumberInfo : ShortStringPropertyInfo
    {
    }
}
```

This code alone does exactly the same as ShortString concept. Now, we have to provide some additional functionality, and that is to add regex validation of the phone number. This is done by implementing IConceptMacro interface and exposing it via MEF (using Export attribute):

``` csharp
using System.ComponentModel.Composition;
using Rhetos.Dsl;
using Rhetos.Dsl.DefaultConcepts;

namespace MyFirstConcept
{
    [Export(typeof (IConceptMacro))]
    public class PhoneNumberMacro : IConceptMacro<PhoneNumberInfo>
    {
        public IEnumerable<IConceptInfo> CreateNewConcepts(PhoneNumberInfo conceptInfo, IDslModel existingConcepts)
        {
            return new IConceptInfo[]
            {
                new RegExMatchInfo
                {
                    Property = conceptInfo,
                    RegularExpression = "^[+]*[(]{0,1}[0-9]{1,4}[)]{0,1}[-\s\./0-9]*$",
                    ErrorMessage = "Invalid phone number format."
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

With those two classes you have just created your first macro concept.

## How to write a basic concept

Defining the IConceptInfo implementation for the basic concept is the same as for the macro concept. Now we have to define a code generator in which we will implement wanted functionality. This is done by implementing IConceptCodeGenerator interface (defined in Rhetos.Compiler.Interfaces assembly).

Let's say we have to implement functionality that Entity with Deactivatable concept defined needs to be deactivated instead of deleted when Delete function is called on it. First, we will implement ConceptInfo for this new concept:

``` csharp
using System.ComponentModel.Composition;
using Rhetos.Dsl;
using Rhetos.Dsl.DefaultConcepts;

namespace Htz.RhetosConcepts
{
    [Export(typeof(IConceptInfo))]
    [ConceptKeyword("DeactivateOnDelete")]
    public class DeactivateOnDeleteInfo : IConceptInfo
    {
        [ConceptKey]
        public DeactivatableInfo Deactivatable { get; set; }
    }
}
```

Now we must implement IConceptCodeGenerator interface and add wanted functionality:

``` csharp
using System;
using System.ComponentModel.Composition;
using Rhetos.Compiler;
using Rhetos.Dom.DefaultConcepts;
using Rhetos.Dsl;
using Rhetos.Extensibility;

namespace Htz.RhetosConcepts
{
    [Export(typeof(IConceptCodeGenerator))]
    [ExportMetadata(MefProvider.Implements, typeof(DeactivateOnDeleteInfo))]
    public class DeactivateOnDeleteCodeGenerator : IConceptCodeGenerator
    {
        public void GenerateCode(IConceptInfo conceptInfo, ICodeBuilder codeBuilder)
        {
            var info = (DeactivateOnDeleteInfo)conceptInfo;

            var code = String.Format(
            @"var deactivated = deleted.ToList();

            foreach(var item in deleted)
                item.Active = false;

            updated = updated.Concat(deleted).ToArray();
            updatedNew = updatedNew.Concat(deleted).ToArray();

            deleted = new Common.Queryable.{0}_{1}[]{{}};
            deletedIds = new {0}.{1}[]{{}};
            ",
                info.Deactivatable.Entity.Module.Name,
                info.Deactivatable.Entity.Name);

            codeBuilder.InsertCode(code, WritableOrmDataStructureCodeGenerator.OldDataLoadedTag, info.Deactivatable.Entity);
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see, this is where it gets a bit tricky. In order to write a code generator you have to now exactly where to place your code and the context in which your code will be run. There is no other way of finding that out but to browse already  generated code (e.g.. ServerDom.Repositories.cs that can be found in Generated subfolder of your Rhetos server), and Rhetos core source code itself. Best way of doing this is to find similar functionality in [CommonConcepts](#https://github.com/Rhetos/Rhetos/tree/master/CommonConcepts) and work from there. After a while you will get a hang of it and navigate through code generators and generated relatively easy.

## How to deploy created concept

To deploy a newly created Rhetos DSL concept you need to [create a Rhetos package](https://github.com/Rhetos/Rhetos/wiki/Creating-Rhetos-package) and add your binaries to it, or add them to an existing Rhetos package.
